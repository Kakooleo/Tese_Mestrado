abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are biologically inspired computer programs designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes information. ANNs gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data and learn (or are trained) through experience, not from programming. An ANN is formed from hundreds of single units, artificial neurons or processing elements (PE), connected with coefficients (weights), which constitute the neural structure and are organised in layers. The power of neural computations comes from connecting neurons in a network. Each PE has weighted inputs, transfer function and one output. The behavior of a neural network is determined by the transfer functions of its neurons, by the learning rule, and by the architecture itself. The weights are the adjustable parameters and, in that sense, a neural network is a parameterized system. The weighed sum of the inputs constitutes the activation of the neuron. The activation signal is passed through transfer function to produce a single output of the neuron. Transfer function introduces non-linearity to the network. During training, the inter-unit connections are optimized until the error in predictions is minimized and the network reaches the specified level of accuracy. Once the network is trained and tested it can be given new input information to predict the output. Many types of neural networks have been designed already and new ones are invented every week but all can be described by the transfer functions of their neurons, by the learning rule, and by the connection formula. ANN represents a promising modeling technique, especially for data sets having non-linear relationships which are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical processes. In terms of model specification, artificial neural networks require no knowledge of the data source but, since they often contain many weights that must be estimated, they require large training sets. In addition, ANNs can combine and incorporate both literature-based and experimental data to solve problems. The various applications of ANNs can be summarised into classification or pattern recognition, prediction and modeling. Supervised associating networks can be applied in pharmaceutical fields as an alternative to conventional response surface methodology. Unsupervised feature-extracting networks represent an alternative to principal component analysis. Non-adaptive unsupervised networks are able to reconstruct their patterns when presented with noisy samples and can be used for image recognition. The potential applications of ANN methodology in the pharmaceutical sciences range from interpretation of analytical data, drug and dosage form design through biopharmacy to clinical pharmacy.}

abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.}

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

abstract = {Target tracking is a difficult estimation problem due to target motion uncertainty and measurement origin uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the target tracking problem in the presence of only target motion uncertainty. The traditional approaches to address this uncertainty, such as multiple model approaches, can suffer performance degradation when there is a model mismatch. The statistical accuracy of conventional model-based methods is also usually limited because of the measurement errors and insufficient data for the estimation. In this paper, deep neural network-based methods are proposed to handle target motion uncertainty due to their strong capability of fitting any mapping as long as there are sufficient training data. Specifically, a recurrent neural network-based structure is proposed to estimate the true states that is consistent with the sequential manner of target tracking. In addition, it is expected that better performance will be achieved due to access to true states during the training of the networks. We propose two networks that are based on different principles and are capable of real-time tracking. An approach to further reduce the computational load is also introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can handle the target motion uncertainty well and provide better estimation accuracy.}

A precise prediction of PWP is difficult due to complex physical mechanisms and in situ natural variability. To explore the applicability and advantages of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on PWP prediction, three variants of RNNs, i.e., standard RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are adopted and compared with a traditional static artificial neural network (ANN), i.e., multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Measurements of rainfall and PWP of representative piezometers from a fully instrumented natural slope in Hong Kong are used to establish the prediction models. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are used for model evaluations. The influence of input time series length on the model performance is investigated. The results reveal that MLP can provide acceptable performance but is not robust. The uncertainty bounds of RMSE of the MLP model range from 0.24 kPa to 1.12 kPa for the selected two piezometers. The standard RNN can perform better but the robustness is slightly affected when there are significant time lags between PWP changes and rainfall. The GRU and LSTM models can provide more precise and robust predictions than the standard RNN. The effects of the hidden layer structure and the dropout technique are investigated. The single-layer GRU is accurate enough for PWP prediction, whereas a double-layer GRU brings extra time cost with little accuracy improvement. The dropout technique is essential to overfitting prevention and improvement of accuracy.}

Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in detail.

abstract = {This paper proposes a data-driven approach to estimating geometric track irregularities from instrumented railway vehicle (IRV) data. Machine learning is used to find the nonlinear mapping between IRV data and track irregularities. A dynamic model of the BRA1 railway vehicle was used to generate an artificial dataset that contains variables that are measured by the real BRA1 IRV and other variables measured by IRVs found in the literature. An extensive data analysis step was done to verify if the current instrumentation of the BRA1 IRV is sufficient for obtaining both lateral and vertical track irregularities. Feature engineering based on wagon movements, signal integration and time domain statistical metrics were applied to extract features and then the best features were selected using a wrapper method. Eight different regression ML models were trained and optimized after the feature selection using Optuna. The results show that, with the current instrumentation of the BRA1 IRV, obtaining lateral track irregularities is unlikely due to low correlation, however, vertical irregularities can be obtained with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.556 mm. With postprocessing, the RMSE was further reduced to 0.410 mm.}

However, numerous existing drive-by monitoring methods rely on supervised learning models, necessitating extensive labelled data for each line. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed based on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) concept which facilitates the transfer of a geometric defects diagnosis model learned from one line to a new line without the need for any labelled data from the new line. The proposed framework learns the dynamic-based features that are sensitive to damage and also invariant to different railway tracks. It comprises three components: data pre-processing, UDA implementation, and damage diagnosis. The framework uses the data from the source domain, including corresponding labels, as well as the unlabelled data from the target domain as input. The outputs of the framework consist of the predicted labels for the target domain. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of field measurements of a high-speed train passing 4 different lines within the French high-speed rail network. The proposed UDA framework is implemented using four common UDA algorithms including Information-Theoretical Learning (ITL), Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK), Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), and Subspace Alignment (SA). The results show that the proposed framework has a 14% increase in the anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional unsupervised learning methods in which UDA is not used. Furthermore, this study investigates the impact of incorporating a percentage of target data labels during training (semi-supervised domain adaptation), along with various sensor layouts and different tuning parameters, on the accuracy of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed framework can significantly facilitate the monitoring of railway track conditions using the data collected by in-service trains which could be great interest of railway owners.}

ABSTRACT = {Track and preventive maintenance are necessary for the safe and comfortable operation of railways. Track displacement measured by track inspection vehicles or trolleys has been primarily used for track management. Thus, vibration data measured in in-service vehicles have not been extensively used for track management. In this study, we propose a new technique for estimating track irregularities from measured car body vibration for track management. The correlation between track irregularity and car body vibration was analysed using a multibody dynamics simulation of travelling rail vehicles. Gaussian process regression (GPR) was applied to the track irregularity and car body vibration data obtained from the simulation, and a method was proposed to estimate the track irregularities from the constructed regression model. The longitudinal-level, alignment, and cross-level irregularities were estimated from the measured car body vibrations and travelling speeds on a regional railway, and the results were compared with the actual track irregularity data. The results showed that the proposed method is applicable for track irregularity management in regional railways.},

abstract = {Monitoring the condition of the infrastructure based on measurements coming from in-service trains is a recent trend in the policies of railway infrastructure managers and is seen as a major factor to reduce maintenance costs retaining the present levels of passengers’ ride comfort and availability of the lines. Aim of this paper is to develop and assess model-based methods for the identification of geometric track irregularities from acceleration measurements taken on-board vehicles travelling on the track. In particular, the paper focusses on the identification of lateral alignment irregularities, a yet unsolved problem which turns out to be much more demanding compared to the identification of longitudinal level irregularities due to the relative wheel-rail motion in lateral direction which occurs on account of the peculiar geometry of wheel-rail contact. The paper presents three different approaches to the estimation of the lateral and cross-level track irregularities, one defined in the frequency domain and two in the time domain. For each method, an assessment is performed based on numerical experiments in which virtual measurements from vehicle-mounted sensors are obtained by means of numerical simulations performed using a multi-body model of a railway vehicle. For the method defined in the frequency domain, a first application to line measurements is presented.}

abstract = { In recent years, significant studies have focused on monitoring the track geometry irregularities through measurements of vehicle dynamics acquired onboard. Most of these studies analyse the vertical irregularity and the vertical vehicle dynamics since the lateral direction is much more challenging due to the non-linearities caused by the contact between the wheels and the rails. In the present work, a machine learning-based fault classifier for the condition monitoring of track irregularities in the lateral direction is proposed. The classifiers are trained with a dataset composed of numerical simulation results and validated with a dataset of measurements acquired by a diagnostic vehicle on the straight track sections of a high-speed line (300 km/h). Classifiers based on decision tree, linear and Gaussian support vector machine algorithms are developed and compared in terms of performance: good results are achieved with the three algorithms, especially with the Gaussian support vector machine. Even though classifiers are data driven, they retain the essence of lateral dynamics. }

abstract = {Rail car safety and stability are important factors for good performance. The most used safety index to quantify railway safety is the ratio between the lateral and vertical wheel rail contact forces (L/Q). This study aims to use machine learning (ML) models to evaluate the viability of estimating the wheel rail contact forces from sensors in a regular instrumented railway vehicle (IRV). A virtual model of a BRA1 railway vehicle was created to generate an artificial dataset with variables measured with the actual BRA1 vehicle plus different variables measured by other IRVs found in the literature. The desired output variable is the L/Q ratio for each wheel of the leading bogie. Exploratory data analysis was done to clarify the correlation between the variables while model explainability techniques were applied to evaluate the contribution of these input variables to the output (L/Q). A total of 24 embedded machine learning models were trained and optimized using the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) to generate a ML pipeline capable of producing an accurate L/Q ratio as the output for different cases of sampling rate, input variables and track irregularities. The results show that machine learning models can predict the wheel rail contact forces indirectly – without using instrumented wheelsets – with the highest mean squared error being equal to 0.01113.}
