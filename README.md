# Academic Work Template â€“ Provisional Version

This model is **provisional** until the official model is updated to the new CCPG standards!

---

## Encoding Requirement
To use this academic work template, your editor must be set to **UTF-8 encoding**.  
This setting applies to **all files** involved in producing the academic work using this template.

---

## Important Recommendations
- **Read the entire generated PDF** file `trabalho.pdf` before making any changes to the template's source code.
- This template is an adaptation of the **Canonical Academic Work Template** provided by the [abnTeX2 team](http://www.abntex.net.br/).  
  For a better understanding of its structure, keep the **abnTeX2 class manuals** on hand.
